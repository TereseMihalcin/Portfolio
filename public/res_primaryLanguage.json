      "description": "My name is Terese Mihalcin. I am a Web Developer at Creative Circle Media Solutions. I have been employed there for over two years. My day to day work has a direct impact on local newspaper and other media companies. I am passionate about creating flexible and reusable code that solves real world problems. I am comfortable collaborating with clients and making sure their needs are met. I regularly use PHP MySQL for backend and data processes, and HTML, CSS and Javascript for Frontend Display. I enjoy working with python and experimenting with Javascript Frameworks in my spare time. As for my education, I have studied Computer Science at Seton Hill University for four years, and earned my BS in Computer Science in May 2022. I feel that the tools I received as Seton Hill University gave me the ability to follow the path I am aiming for. Outside of my studies, I played collegiate volleyball at Seton Hill for four years. I still continue to enjoy volleyball in various, more casul, adult leagues. Additionally, I also enjoy many outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, and kayaking.",
